# GuessNBA

GuessNBA is a mobile-based web game that I created in a few days during winter break of my Freshman year in college.

The program scrapes NBA data from the website basketball-reference.com and find information about a random player.<br>
The user then has to guess the player based on three of their stats, or more if they need hints.
